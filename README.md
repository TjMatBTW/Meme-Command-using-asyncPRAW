A simple meme command that sends the top submissions of a subreddit using asyncPRAW (The Asynchronous Python Reddit API Wrapper, more compatible)

asyncPRAW was originally created by Joel Payne.

I decided to make this as I only found 1 video teaching how to make a command like this on YouTube, and the code in the video had bugs. 
If you have any problems, send me a DM in Discord as I don't check other social media often. Idon't usually accept random friend requests, 
so I recommend joining a server where I'm in so you can DM me. If there, look for my username TjMat#0001.
