A simple meme command that sends the top submissions of a subreddit using asyncPRAW (The Asynchronous Python Reddit API Wrapper, more compatible)

asyncPRAW was originally created by Joel Payne.

-------------------------------------------------//-------------------------------------------------

I decided to make this as I only found 1 video teaching how to make a command using this process on YouTube, and the code in the video had bugs. 
If you have any problems, send me a DM in Discord as I don't check other social media often. I don't usually accept random friend requests, 
so I recommend joining a server where I'm in so you can DM me. If there, look for my username ``TjMat#0001``.

Useful websites:

1. asyncPRAW Documentation (I strongly recommend reading this, there is a lot of useful information that might help you starting): https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 
2. Discord.py Documentation: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

-------------------------------------------------//-------------------------------------------------

Steps:

1. Install asyncPRAW through Command Prompt: ``pip install asyncpraw``
(If you already have it, simply upgrade it using ``pip install --upgrade asyncpraw``
For older and testing versions refer to https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
2. Create a Reddit Application through https://reddit.com/prefs/apps [MAKE SURE YOU SELECT PERSONAL SCRIPT, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!]
3. Write the code provided in ``main.py`` in a file. (I expect that you have minimum knowledge of Python/how to make a bot work to configure this command)
4. Fill in the gaps with your account & application information. For the Client ID and secret, check the picture, the username is your account username, and the password is your account username, the User Agent can be whatever you want. In the about URL and in the redirect URI, simply type ``https://localhost:8080``. 
5. Run the bot and test the command.

Please note that sending the meme will take a few seconds.
